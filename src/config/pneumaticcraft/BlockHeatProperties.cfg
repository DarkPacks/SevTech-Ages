  "Description": [
    "Defines custom heat properties of blocks & fluids, which are keyed by either a blockstate name or a fluid name.",
    "Block names MUST be in the form <modid>:<blockname>, fluid names are just a <fluidname>",
    "Blockstate variants should only be used to distinguish subtypes of blocks, never properties such as block-facing.",
    "If you're not sure of a fluid name, hold a bucket of the fluid, and type '/dumpNBT'.",
    "'temperature' is mandatory for non-fluids; for fluids it uses the fluid's temperature (mod-defined) by default",
    "'thermalResistance' defines how quickly heat moves into or out of the block",
    "'totalHeat' defines the max amount of heat that can be removed or added before the block undergoes a state change",
    "'transformHot' and 'transformCold' define what block/fluid this will become on a state change",
    "'transformHotFlowing' and 'transformColdFlowing' are for fluids only and apply to flowing (non-source) fluid blocks"
