Open the Advancements Window to find out how to progress (Default key "L")

WAILA and a Map are not available from the beginning of the modpack, they need to be unlocked. There are many blocks that are hidden until unlocked through progression!

**Be aware, if you change a resource pack while the pack is running you will need to fully restart the game due to an issue with items not hiding correctly and recipes not showing. Sorry for the inconvenience!**

For Multiplayer Team information use the mod "Together Forever" and check the commands beginning with "/tofe" using in-game chat.

Bug Fixes:

Enhancements:
* Hide junk from JEI

Mod Updates:
* Modular Machinery (1.9.5)
* MPBasic Tools (1.4.11)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.0

Important Notes:
* The modpack has had a complete re-write of all the CraftTweaker Scripts to make our lives easier during development along with easier updates. However in the process some bugs may show from items
being staged wrong. Or recipes not working correctly, we have done all the testing we can to ensure this won't happen. But with all development processes things will get past QA. So if you find
any problems please report them to our tracker, thanks!
* Tomb Many Graves has been removed! So what does this mean for me? Well if you have any graves lying around they are now gone. The change has been done due to the lack of support from other mods
in the pack which TMG was not getting all the player items. Leading to item loss and users not playing the pack again. So we have changed to using Corails Tombstone which has the mod support we
need, along with some added items which will help the player in the long run. Also for you builders out there, you now have graves to place around your base! We're sorry if you've lost items from
the old graves. But this is a major update and we had to make the change now rather than later. We hope you can understand this.
* If you get a crash relating to `java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: OpenGL45` your LWJGL is out of date. The needed version is 2.9.4 if your using MultiMC you can change the version in the instance settings.
Twitch you should use the Jar Launcher as this will auto use the correct version. Likewise for ATLauncher.
* Refined Storage (1.6) has a major change in how the mod works. So please review the changes to see what's broken on your network. There is nothing we can do on the pack side to help with, the possible
breakage of your networks/autocrafting etc... So please ensure you read the changelog and understand the changes done by the mod. The modder has put work into upgrading current networks. But expect to find
issues! This is your only warning about this. So don't open issues on the tracker about issues. Unless it's an actual bug with the mod!
* Viescraft has been updated (which the mod did a refactor) this means that your ships will vanish, along with some items. This is another thing we can't control with mod updates. All we can say is sorry. Feel free to
spawn in components to re-make your ships. Note: Ship building changed a bit so please read up on the changes.
* ContentTweaker Molten Fiery is now removed (deprecated in 3.0.8)
* Astral Sorcery has a new perk system, and as a result the mod will reset your perk experience.
* Astral Sorcery rituals may not be active after upgrading. To restart them, simply pick up the crystal from the pedestal and place it back down.
* The Compact Machines Advancement ("Project Miniaturization") may have been reset if you currently had the advancement. See https://github.com/DarkPacks/SevTech-Ages/issues/3594#issuecomment-471080837 for a resolution.

      Modular Machine which enables easier Ore processing this is based on the Mekanism spec but does not require all the normal machines as
      you'd normally needed. Also you grain the secondary outputs for valid ores. So your getting more Dollars per Bill! All the recipes are
      listed in JEI. Note however due to how the JEI is built for Modular Machinery the UI is not scaling correctly this may be solved in a
      later update but we'll post on the Wiki the power usage/conversions for the machines to give more details.
