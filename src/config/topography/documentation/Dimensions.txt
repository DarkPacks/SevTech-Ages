This file is for the options in dimension script files. These are the files referenced 
when registering dimensions in the Topography.txt file. These files can be placed 
anywhere in the config/topography folder, and must end in '.txt'.



disableNetherPortal:
    Notes:
        Disables the creation of a nether portal in the dimension.

generateNetherFortress:
    Notes:
        Adds nether fortresses to the dimension with rarity settings approximately the same as vanilla.

generateNetherFortress:
    Arguments:
        int, int, int
    Usage:
        spawn chance, area, random area
    Notes:
        Adds nether fortresses to the dimension. Once in every area*area chunk area there is a 1/spawn chance for a nether fortress to spawn, with a random*random area being used for randomly placing the fortress in the total area. Approximate vanilla values are 3, 16, 4.

enableRelightChecks:
    Notes:
        Enables a very large number of relight checks to be done on each chunk after generation is complete, spread out over a small number of ticks. This causes a very large amount of lag, but is required in dimensions like a lava based nether in order to get the lava to actually emit light.

generateMineshaft:
    Notes:
        Adds mineshafts to the dimension.

disableRespawning:
    Notes:
        Disables respawning in the dimension.

        celestial angle
    Notes:
        Sets a static celestial angle for the dimension. Useful for forcing it to always be day or not.

generateStronghold:
    Notes:
        Adds strongholds to the dimension.

enableEnviromentalFog:
    Notes:
        Enables enviromental fog. This is the short distance spherical fog used in the nether in vanilla.

setSpawnStructure:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        structure file path
    Notes:
        Sets the spawn structure for the dimension, at height 64. The file path is relative to the config/topography/structures folder and does not use the file extension.

setSpawnStructure:
    Arguments:
        String, int
    Usage:
        structure file path, height
    Notes:
        Sets the spawn structure for the dimension, at the provided height. The file path is relative to the config/topography/structures folder and does not use the file extension.

    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        script path
    Notes:
        Sets the script at the provided path to be used to generate the Biome Provider for the dimension.

setLightBrightnessTable:
    Arguments:
        float array
    Usage:
        brightness table
    Notes:
        Sets an array used for how bright light appears in the dimension. Does not effect the actual light level, just how bright that light appers in the rendering. This array must have 16 values between 0 and 1. In vanilla this is used in the nether to increase the brightness of low light values, making the dimension not as dark while also hiding the large number of lighting errors. The array used for the nether is [0.1, 0.11578947, 0.13333333, 0.15294117, 0.175, 0.20000002, 0.22857141, 0.26153848, 0.3, 0.34545457, 0.4, 0.46666667, 0.5500001, 0.6571429, 0.79999995, 1.0]

setSkyRenderer:
    Notes:
        Sets a SkyRendererCustom for the dimension, and returns it.

captureTeleports:
    Notes:
        If this dimension has a spawn structure set, then when teleporting to the dimension, this option cancels the dimension change and has Topography transfer the player itself, placing them in the spawn position on the spawn structure.

vaporizeWater:
    Notes:
        This enables the vanilla nether option to have water/ice evaporate when placed in the dimension.

setRiver:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID_Array, Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        biomes to set river for, river to set

    Notes:
        Adds scattered features to the dimension. This includes swamp huts, igloos, desert pyramids and jungle pyramids.
