# SORTING RULES
# Each line you type is a new constraint you add for sorting your inventory.
# After any change, just press the sorting key to reload the settings. Some examples:
# * "D1 sword" puts any sword in row D, column 1 (see grid below)
# * "A edibleFood" fills the A row with food
# * "1 ironPickaxe" fills the 1 column with an iron pickaxe
# * "A1-C4 blocks" fills the rectangle with any blocks
# * "D LOCKED" avoids items from the hotbar to move out of it when sorting
